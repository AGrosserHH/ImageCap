# ImageCap
Exampe for Image captioning

The folder includes three examples / tries on image captioning:
- Image Captionign Keras includes the code for Image captioning taken from a certain web page (indicated in the jupyter notebook 
Image Captioning Keras.ipynb)

- Object detection via Google Vision: The notebook object_detection_example.ipynb includes a try to use Google Vision API for Object detection. In the example the code is used for video analysis (object_detection_example_mer.ipynb)

- The last try includes image captioning via Tensorflow taken from a book ("lstm_image_caption.ipynb")
